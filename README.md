# Easy Tech Seniors

A clean, minimal GitHub Pages site for a local IT support service focused on seniors.  
Includes accessible controls, seminar filtering, and a contact form.

## Quick Start
1. Create a new GitHub repository and upload all files in this folder.
2. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages** and set **Build and deployment** to deploy from `main` branch, `/ (root)`.
3. Replace:
   - `hello@example.com` and phone number in footer/contact.
   - `https://formspree.io/f/your-id` with your Formspree endpoint (or use a mailto link).
   - Dates/locations in `_data/seminars.yml`.
4. Commit & push. Your site will build automatically.

## Customize
- Edit colors/spacing in `assets/css/style.css` (currently black & white).
- Add/remove pages by editing `.md` files at repo root.
- Update the logo at `assets/img/logo.svg`.

## Accessibility
- High contrast toggle, text size controls, large touch targets, readable fonts.
